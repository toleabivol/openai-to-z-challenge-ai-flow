    ## 🔍 Raw Analysis
    
    Overlaying the DEMs and optical bands shows three distinct anomaly types in the 10 km diameter AOI: 1) Modern rectilinear clearings in the SE quadrant (likely agricultural), 2) faint arcuate/circular patterns in central-east forest (subtle on NDVI/NBR), 3) low-relief linear terraces/ridges on gentle slopes in the north.  

• In the Landsat and Sentinel-2 false-color composites (SWIR–NIR–Red), the agricultural blocks stand out as dark polygons against the bright forest.  
• On the S2 NDVI and NBR, small circular outlines (~200–300 m diameter) appear as slightly depressed vegetation vigor in a NW–SE band east of center.  
• The 30 m DEM hillshade reveals subtle, regularly spaced low ridges/terraces on the northern slope, aligned roughly perpendicular to drainage channels, visible also in the S2 NIR as alternating tone bands.
    
    
    ## 📌 Hotspots
    
    
    ### 🔸 Hotspot 1
    
    - **Latitude:** -3.5079
    - **Longitude:** -55.4742
    - **Radius:** 200 meters
    - **Rationale:** Cluster of ~20 rectangular polygons (200–500 m across) in the SE quadrant showing identical orientation and edges—modern clearings visible in true-color, false-color and NBR composites. Unnatural grid pattern indicates anthropogenic tree removal rather than natural clearing; useful to delineate modern disturbance as a negative archaeological indicator.
    - **Score:** 15 / 100

    ### 🔸 Hotspot 2
    
    - **Latitude:** -3.4944
    - **Longitude:** -55.4921
    - **Radius:** 150 meters
    - **Rationale:** Faint concentric/arc-shaped rings ~250 m across on the east side of the forest interior. These are subtle low-NDVI depressions on the Sentinel-2 NDVI and NBR, and appear as slight embayment patterns in the hillshade—potential earthwork or geoglyph feature under closed canopy.
    - **Score:** 65 / 100

    ### 🔸 Hotspot 3
    
    - **Latitude:** -3.5169
    - **Longitude:** -55.4831
    - **Radius:** 250 meters
    - **Rationale:** Series of evenly spaced, low-relief linear ridges/terraces trending NW-SE on gentle northern slopes. Visible in both 30 m DEM hillshade products and as alternating reflectance bands in S2 NIR imagery. Pattern and regular spacing (100–200 m) suggest former agricultural terraces or trail networks.
    - **Score:** 55 / 100
