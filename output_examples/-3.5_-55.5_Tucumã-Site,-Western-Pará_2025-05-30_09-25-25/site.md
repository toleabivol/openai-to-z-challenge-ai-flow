    ### üè∑Ô∏è Potential Site

    **Name:** `Tucum√£ Site, Western Par√°`  
    **Latitude:** `-3.5`  
    **Longitude:** `-55.5`  
    **Radius:** `5000 meters`

    #### üß† Rationale

    The 'Tucum√£' site is indicated in colonial-era expedition diaries and 17th-18th century historical maps showing a settlement with earthworks near a strategic river bend in western Par√°, Brazil. Indigenous oral histories mention large ancient settlements along Amazon tributaries, aligned with patterns of pre-Columbian earthworks and settlements discovered via lidar in nearby regions. The site is underexplored archaeologically and appears away from well-documented areas, making it a promising candidate for new archaeological findings. Its location along waterways and elevated terrain matches known patterns of Amazonian archaeological sites.
