Online Research Repositories :

    Internet Archive Sources https://archive.org/search?query=lost+city+of+z for a library of text, audio, and video material to sort through.

    Library of Congress public‑domain expedition books https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdclccn.02029950/?st=gallery – contains detailed river‑mile diaries and
    Indigenous village positions you can geocode.

    Archaeological sites tend to appear in
    similar places (along waterways, in higher elevations, along trade routes). Look at the known site location
    patterns and if you see trends regionally, they may result in discoveries in similar places.

    Cross-check against published geoglyph databases and academic reports so you’re not researching already known sites, 
    but new site adjacent to already known sites is allowed.
    Replace prohibited words like swastika or any other prohibited word with the appropriate word or description that is
    allowed, like 'geoglyph', in the search, search output, prompts and in the output.
    
    Expected output: 
    One potential new archeological site based on the research with highest probability 
    of new findings. The output should be a short name, a list of coordinates 
    (latitude, longitude, radius) in WGS84 format followed by a short rationale, followed by direct 
    links to the google, bing, sentinel hub https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/?zoom={zoom}&lat={lat}&lng={lang} and livingatlas https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/wayback/#active=34007&mapCenter={long}%2C{lat}%2C14 maps with satellite layer and proper zoom level, 
    followed by urls to public resources to back the rationale. Must have at least one historical map or text.Findings should be reasonably bound by the Amazon biome in Northern South America. Focus on Brazil, with allowed extension into the outskirts of Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela, and French Guiana.

Verify coordinates using:
    - Provided Satellite image analysis;
    - Textual location descriptions;
    - Cross-reference with Historical maps;
    - Cross-reference with historical text (diary snippet, oral map).
    Give each identified hotspot a score from 1 to 100 bsed on the likelihood of being new historical or archaeological findings.
    Be realistic - if you do not see potential hotspots to have real archaeological or historical that is fine. You can reevaluate the hotspots' score as well.
    Replace prohibited words like swastika or any other prohibited word with the appropriate word or description that is
    allowed, like 'geoglyph', in the search, search output, prompts and in the output

Produce final report with:
    - Confirmed coordinates (WGS84) of at least 1 potential site;
    - Confidence scoring 1-100 where 1 is not likely and 100 is likely that the potential site is worth further investigation;
    - Compares the discovery to an already known archaeological feature;
    Verified report with confirmed coordinates and recommendations. 
    Include also the google, bing, sentinel hub, livingatlas map links to the coordinates.
    If no hotspots identified by the validation or image analysis keep the report short as you do not have any confirmed potential site and report a false finding. .
