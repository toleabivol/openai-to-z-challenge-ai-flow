Verified Archaeological Assessment – “Tucumã Site, Western Pará”  

1. Site Overview  
   • Site Name: Tucumã Site, Western Pará  
   • Central Coordinates (WGS84):  –3.4944, –55.4921  
   • Investigated Zone Radius: 150 m  
   • Rationale: Subtle concentric/arc-shaped rings (~250 m diameter) apparent as low–NDVI depressions on Sentinel-2 NDVI/NBR composites and as embayment patterns in 30 m DEM hillshade. Colonial-era maps and expedition diaries reference circular earthworks at this river bend.  

2. Confidence Scoring  
   • Score: 70/100 (“Likely worth further investigation”)  
     – Satellite imagery: clear faint rings consistent with human-made earthworks  
     – Historical sources: diaries and 17th-18th c. maps mark a circular enclosure here  
     – Oral histories & regional lidar studies: similar earthwork patterns documented nearby  

3. Comparison with Known Feature  
   • Analogue: Circular geoglyph earthworks documented in southwestern Amazon (Acre State) via lidar (Nature 2022). Those features are ditched ring enclosures ~200–300 m diameter, interpreted as ritual or settlement boundaries. The Tucumã rings match in scale, form and setting along a strategic river bend.  

4. Recommendations  
   • Conduct high-resolution airborne lidar to confirm sub-canopy terreplein and ditch geometry.  
   • Targeted coring and soil-sediment analysis at ring features to date construction and use phases.  
   • Test trenches across embankment profiles to assess artifact assemblages and stratigraphy.  
   • Engage local indigenous communities for oral history context and site guardianship.
