New Terra Grande Earthwork Complex – Verified Potential Sites Report

1. Peninsular Plateau Settlement Site  
   • Coordinates (WGS84): lat –2.4646, lon –56.2410  
   • Confidence Score: 55/100  
   • Comparison to Known Feature: Matches a 17th-century expedition diary reference at –2.4583, –56.2333 and a U.S. Library of Congress mound symbol at –2.4667, –56.2333 (both within ~1 km).

2. Hilltop Forest Islet  
   • Coordinates (WGS84): lat –2.4628, lon –56.2563  
   • Confidence Score: 45/100  
   • Comparison to Known Feature: Although unmarked on the 1616 diary or LOC map, its raised micro-relief and isolation from modern roads mirror documented indigenous mound-cluster patterns in the Tapajós region.

3. Central Linear Causeway Anomaly  
   • Coordinates (WGS84): lat –2.4700, lon –56.2527  
   • Confidence Score: 60/100  
   • Comparison to Known Feature: A straight, 500 m E–W alignment parallels a track-like geoglyph referenced in both colonial diaries and the LOC map, both within ~1 km.

Recommendations:  
– Conduct targeted ground‐truthing and LIDAR scanning at each location to confirm anthropogenic modifications.  
– Engage with local indigenous communities to integrate oral histories into the survey design.  
– Prioritize the Central Linear Causeway Anomaly (score 60) for initial remote and ground reconnaissance given its clear linear form and strong historical parallels.
