    #### üß† Rationale

    This location south of Santar√©m, near the Tapaj√≥s River, aligns with indigenous oral histories describing large ancient settlements near river bends and elevated terraces. Colonial-era expedition diaries reference unverified mound earthworks roughly in this area. Historical maps mark several indigenous villages and ceremonial sites along the Tapaj√≥s with some unconfirmed earthworks nearby. Recent lidar-based archaeological reports highlight similar settlement patterns in the surrounding region, with complex pre-Columbian earthworks constructed by advanced societies. Importantly, this site is outside current urban areas but adjacent to known clusters of pre-Columbian villages, suggesting potential for new discoveries. The combination of traditional oral narratives, colonial records, historical cartography, and modern archaeological patterns provide strong multi-source rationale for this site‚Äôs high probability of undiscovered archaeological remains.
