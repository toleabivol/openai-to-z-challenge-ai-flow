1. Peninsular Plateau Settlement Site @ –2.4646, –56.2410  
   Score: 55  
   Rationale: Confirmed by DEM hillshade & NDVI analysis, and matches 17th-century diary (–2.4583, –56.2333) and LOC map mound symbol (–2.4667, –56.2333) within ~1 km.  

2. Hilltop Forest Islet @ –2.4628, –56.2563  
   Score: 45  
   Rationale: Subtle raised platform in DEM & NDVI. While not explicitly marked on the 1616 diary or LOC map, its proximity (~1.5 km) to documented settlements and common indigenous mound-cluster patterns supports moderate potential.  

3. Central Linear Causeway Anomaly @ –2.4700, –56.2527  
   Score: 60  
   Rationale: Straight 500 m feature visible in multispectral imagery. Aligns within ~1 km of both the LOC map earthwork symbol and diary mound coordinates, suggesting this could be the track or geoglyph referenced in historical records.
