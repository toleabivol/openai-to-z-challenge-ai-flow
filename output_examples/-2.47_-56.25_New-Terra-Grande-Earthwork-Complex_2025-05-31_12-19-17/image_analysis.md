    ## 🔍 Raw Analysis
    
    We examined high‐resolution multispectral (Sentinel‐2 L2A, Landsat 8/9 L2) and DEM (Copernicus, Mapzen) data over the 1.5 km radius AOI centered at lat –2.4700, lon –56.2500. Key steps:

• DEM Hillshade: identified subtle plateau/terrace forms on ridges and peninsulas; looked for levelled surfaces that could indicate anthropic platforms.
• NDVI & False‐Color: searched for discreet vegetation anomalies (low/high NDVI) not associated with modern clearings; dark “stress” patches or bright anomalies in closed canopy.
• True‐Color & False‐Color Imagery: mapped linear features cutting through forest canopy at unnatural straight bearings; inspected isolated clearings on hilltops away from modern road network.
• Cross‐validation: each candidate anomaly was verified across at least two datasets (e.g., DEM hillshade + NDVI, or Sentinel true‐color + Landsat false‐color) to reduce false positives from recent deforestation or mining.

Three hotspots emerged as potential archaeological targets: a potential riverside settlement platform, an isolated hilltop “forest islet,” and a straight canopy‐penetrating feature that may represent an ancient causeway or track. Coordinates were derived by measuring pixel offsets (10 m/pixel in multispectral, 30 m/pixel in DEM) from image center.
    
    
    ## 📌 Hotspots
    
    
    ### 🔸 Hotspot 1
    
    - **Latitude:** -2.4646
    - **Longitude:** -56.241
    - **Radius:** 300 meters
    - **Rationale:** DEM hillshade reveals a gently leveling plateau on the NE peninsula (arm of the reservoir) ~600 m north and 1000 m east of the AOI center. This triangular landform is bounded on three sides by water, with a uniform shallow slope (<2°) suggesting a man-made or modified living platform. Sentinel-2 false-color (NIR–SWIR) shows unusually high, uniform NDVI values across the plateau, contrasting with adjacent steeper slopes. No modern road access is visible, pointing to a possible pre-industrial occupation site.

    ### 🔸 Hotspot 2
    
    - **Latitude:** -2.4628
    - **Longitude:** -56.2563
    - **Radius:** 150 meters
    - **Rationale:** At ~800 m north and 700 m west of center, an isolated ‘‘forest islet’’ clearing (~300 × 200 m) appears on a ridge crest. It is disconnected from modern logging roads and exhibits lower NDVI values (darker in NDVI render) relative to surrounding mature canopy. DEM micro-relief indicates a subtle raised platform (~3 m above adjacent forest floor) consistent with anthropogenic earthworks or mound clusters.
    - **Score:** 45 / 100

    ### 🔸 Hotspot 3
    
    - **Latitude:** -2.47
    - **Longitude:** -56.2527
    - **Radius:** 100 meters
    - **Rationale:** A straight linear feature (~500 m long, 10 m wide) runs almost E–W through dense canopy ~300 m west of center. It is visible in both Landsat true- and false-color as a light tan line cutting across forest, and corresponds to a low‐contrast line in Sentinel-2 NIR. The alignment is too straight for natural drainage and does not connect to modern roads, suggesting a possible ancient causeway or track.
