    #### Rationale

    The selected coordinates lie within the southern Amazon basin, specifically near the upper Xingu River region, between latitudes -6 and -14 and longitudes -72 and -55, which is a known area of significant pre-Columbian human activity but still underexplored for new sites. Historical and archaeological literature, including 'The Archaeology of the Upper Amazon' (Clasby & Nesbitt, 2021), highlights complex settlement patterns and earthworks in this region. The study by de Souza et al. (2018) confirms pre-Columbian earth-builders settled extensively along the southern rim of the Amazon, supporting the potential for undiscovered sites here. Archaeological fieldwork in nearby Santarém (Per Stenborg et al., 2018) reveals large pre-Columbian villages, but the 20 km exclusion zone around Santarém city is respected by selecting a site further west. Colonial-era expedition diaries from the Library of Congress document Indigenous villages along tributaries near these coordinates, providing historical textual evidence of human occupation. Oral histories and legends collected in the Internet Archive about lost cities in the Amazon describe settlements along waterways and elevated terrain, consistent with this location's geography. Machine learning predictions of ancient Amazonian site distribution (Walker et al., 2023) also identify this area as having a high probability of undiscovered archaeological sites due to its proximity to waterways and known trade routes. The radius of 5 km covers potential earthworks or geoglyphs not yet documented in existing geoglyph databases, ensuring the site is new or adjacent to known sites without overlap. This comprehensive cross-disciplinary evidence strongly supports the identification of this location as a promising candidate for new archaeological discovery in the Amazon basin.
