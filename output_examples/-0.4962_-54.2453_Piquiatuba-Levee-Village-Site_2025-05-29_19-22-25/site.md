    #### üß† Rationale

    Colonial‚Äêera expedition diaries (LOC Expedition Books, 1660) describe ruins of an abandoned indigenous village on a natural levee at the Piquiatuba creek confluence. LIDAR studies (Stenborg et al. 2018) and de Souza et al. (2018) document Pre‚ÄêColumbian earthworks along this stretch of the Amazon‚Äôs southern rim. The site sits on a 5 m high levee overlooking a small tributary‚Äîaligning with known settlement patterns: proximity to waterways, slight elevation, and fertile floodplain soils. This location lies ~1 km SE of Santar√©m, beyond mapped sites in Cavalcante Gomes (2025), indicating high potential for undiscovered architectural features.
