{"analysis_raw":"The multispectral and DEM imagery overlaid on the proposed general potential site centered at lat -2.5023, lon -54.6931 with a radius of 500 meters shows mostly typical Amazonian landscape. The DEM data (30m resolution) indicates typical floodplain and riverine topology with no prominent artificial elevated mounds or anomalies that would suggest archaeological earthworks.\n\nThe Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery (10m resolution) in true color and false color composites emphasize the dense vegetation and agricultural patterns. Analysis of NDVI and false color composites aimed to detect vegetation anomalies that might indicate subsurface archaeological features such as earthworks impacting vegetation health and growth.\n\nNo clear geometric patterns, polygonal shapes, or rectilinear anomalies appear in the vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, NBR) or visible bands that suggest ancient constructions or settlement remains. The circular or rectangular spectral anomalies commonly associated with Amazonian geoglyphs or pre-Columbian raised fields were not observed.\n\nThe area contains a mix of natural forest cover, agricultural land, and river islands, without spectral or terrain signatures indicative of unknown archaeological or historic sites. No clear elevated structures or mounds identifiable in DEM stand out from the natural terrain.\n\nGiven the uniform landscape and lack of distinctive archaeological spectral or elevation anomalies across all datasets, no specific hotspots meeting criteria for possible new findings can be reliably identified within the examined 500 m radius site area.","hotspots":[]}
