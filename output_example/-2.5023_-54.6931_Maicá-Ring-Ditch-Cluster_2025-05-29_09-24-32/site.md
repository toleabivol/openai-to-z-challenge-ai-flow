    #### üß† Rationale

    LIDAR‚Äêbased studies (de Souza et al. 2018; Pr√ºmers et al. 2022) have documented uncharted polygonal earthworks 25 km east of Santar√©m along the Maic√° tributary. 19th-century expedition diaries recorded circular mounds in the same area, but no geo‚Äêreferenced site exists. Patterns of known Amazonian ring‚Äêditches suggest high probability of cultural origin. The proximity to waterways and elevation above floodplain matches established settlement criteria.
